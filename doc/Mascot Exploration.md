# What this is
This document is meant to coalesce responses from friends and members of the Richmond community to try and determine what a good mascot for rva.rip may be; with the idea that something great might come out of local Richmonder knowledge and cultural understanding. The goal for this mascot is to become the "face" of rva.rip, a shorthand visual cue that can signify the website on stickers, posters, on rva.rip itself, etc. 

# Community Feedback
The initial message sent to most folks, hereafter labeled $initmsg, says the following:

``` Hey, I'm thinking of making a mascot for rva.rip. What are some things you think of as Richmond / any mascot ideas you have? Since the URL is rva.rip I'm thinking a skeleton, but also possums are very Richmond. Idk any thoughts? ```

Btw if you're one of my buds and I didn't message you it's not cause I hate you, I just messaged friends on Signal cause I didn't feel like using sms too. Just download Signal already!!!!

# Initial Conclusions

It seems like a lot of folks took the initial suggestions, skeletons and possums, and either shot those back or combined them into a Skeleton Possum.

Other suggestions, just to have them all in one place, were:

- TV MAN
- Possum wearing sunglasses with backwards hat on a skateboard, think 90s graphic style maybe an oversized tee
- Rats
- PBR
- Black Cats
- Crow
- Vulture
- Decaying Possum
- River rat
- Calvin peeing on James Monroe's tomb
- Giant Skeleton

I will say, I think going with *just* a possum is pastiche. It's 2023 baby, everybody in Bitchmond's got a possum. Idk if we wanna be too busy with it, but I think incorporating that TV Man thing might be dope, I really love him, he's a silly little guy. Overall the most important thing for the design remains being iconic with as little complicated imagery as possible, i.e. the things making it iconic are also easy to replicate on other things and easy for the eye to catch.

Beyond that, I'm not entirely sure what art style we ought to go with though
