# bay.lgbt
an lgbt events aggregator for the SF bay!  
yes!

# The bay.lgbt story (filled with, choices)
- anarchism.nyc is pretty neat! I wonder if the bay has one
- let's rewrite the codebase, (‚ú® but using a frontend framework that might deprecate in a few years ‚ú®)
- let's spend an unreasonable amount of time making it look pretty, before getting any functionality xd
- let's have the client fetch everything; too lazy to get a server run (haha)
- CORS, my old friend... time look for a free CORS proxy :3
- wow the rate limit for Eventbrite sucks. I also don't want client auth...
- ok fine let's make a server
- ...what if we also added server-side rendering?
- ...what if... we hosted on Vercel, despite being in debt?
- `stale-while-revalidate` arc: let's add excessive caching & rate limits so i can sleep at night
- why does everyone use Instagram for events?
- Please stop using Instagram for events. Please stop using Instagram for events. (x100)
- to parse Instagram posts for anything resembling a structured event format, we would probably need to use GPT
- we should also DB server to cache the results so I don't bleed money from OpenAI calls
- why do some Instagram posts... only include event information in the image??
- Please stop using Instagram for events. Please stop using Instagram for events. (x100)
- let's add an OCR AI API ü´†
- *stares at Google's labyrinthian docs for 3 hours figuring out how to get auth*
- ok, it works! but any of these calls might fail... let's sketchily add caching at each step
- (Please stop using Instagram for events. Please stop using Instagram for events.) (x10)
- open beta! (Íàç ‚Äø Íàç ‚úø)
